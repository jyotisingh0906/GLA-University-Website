                <p>I am pursuing B.tech 3rd year from GLA University Mathura. My journey at GLA was full of knowledge and exposure. Teachers give equal importance and concentration to every of the student no matter the student is average or below average.Some Teachers are so supportive and moreover they are not biased. In the initial days of my college, I used to sit numb in the class but teachers at GLA motivated me a lot. There are a lots of activities held at GLA.</p>
